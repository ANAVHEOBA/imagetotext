1. AI-Powered Post-Processing & Correction
Semantic Validation: After OCR, use AI to check if the extracted math “makes sense” (e.g., flag $\int_0^1 x^x dx$ as likely, but $\int_0^1 x^x$ as incomplete).
Auto-Suggest Fixes: If the system is unsure about a symbol, highlight it and offer top-3 alternatives (like Google’s “Did you mean?”).
Math Grammar Checking: Detect and suggest fixes for common LaTeX/math syntax errors.
2. Accessibility & Inclusion
Screen Reader Support: Export alt-text for equations and math content for visually impaired users.
Voice-to-Math: Allow users to dictate equations and have them rendered as LaTeX/Word.
3. Advanced Input Sources
Video Frame Extraction: Let users upload a video (e.g., lecture recording), auto-extract frames with math, and convert them.
Live Camera Mode: Real-time math OCR from webcam or mobile camera, with instant feedback.




4. Document Intelligence
Auto-Sectioning: Detect and preserve document structure (sections, theorems, proofs, captions).
Table & Diagram Extraction: Recognize and convert tables, graphs, and geometric diagrams into editable Word/LaTeX objects or SVGs.
Bibliography & Reference Parsing: Extract and format references/citations.
5. Security & Privacy
On-Device Processing Option: For sensitive data, allow users to run the engine locally (desktop app or browser WASM).
End-to-End Encryption: For cloud processing, ensure all uploads and results are encrypted.
6. Analytics & Feedback Loop
User Correction Analytics: Track where users most often correct OCR output to improve models.
Quality Scoring: Let users rate output quality and flag issues, feeding back into model training.



7. API & Developer Ecosystem
Public API: Let other apps/services integrate your OCR as a backend.
Webhooks & Automation: Allow users to set up “if this, then that” workflows (e.g., auto-save to Google Drive, auto-email results).
8. Education & Community
Step-by-Step Solution Mode: Not just extract math, but also solve and explain it (integrate with CAS like SymPy or Wolfram).
Community Corrections: Let users submit corrections to improve the dataset (crowdsourced labeling).
9. Branding & Virality
Instant Share Links: One-click to share results as a public/private link.
Branded Watermarks: For free users, add subtle branding to outputs to drive word-of-mouth.
10. Enterprise & Compliance
Audit Logs: For institutional users, provide logs of all conversions for compliance.
Custom Model Training: Let large clients fine-tune models on their own data (e.g., publisher-specific notation).
